This is my Senior Capstone Project developed in Spring 2021
This app allows students to locate buildings they are searching for on campus

This was built using React Native framework, a new software to me at the beginning of the semester, as well as Expo for testing on my personal device
With this project I wanted to both challenge myself with learning a new software like React while developing something that could be useful for a large 
group of people.  What I have now is a good base level of what this app could be and I plan to add to it as I continue to learn more about React Native
and as updates are available they will be posted.
